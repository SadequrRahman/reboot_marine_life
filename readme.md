# Reboot the earth

Reboot The Earth is planned as a social coding event that brings young computer programmers    scientists and other interested people together under the auspices of the United Nations to improve upon or build a new software program that addresses the current climate crisis.
To address the problems of marine ecosystem and life under water, here we propuse a platform based soulution which will provide serives to different community who are explicitly and implicitly involved with marine and costal ecosystem e.g. **Commercial Shipping Industry**, **Fishing Industry**, **Sea Food Consumer**, as well as **Rearch groups**.
