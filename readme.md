# Reboot the earth

Reboot The Earth is planned as a social coding event that brings young computer programmers    scientists and other interested people together under the auspices of the United Nations to improve upon or build a new software program that addresses the current climate crisis.
To address the problems of marine ecosystem and life under water, here we propose a platform based solution which will provide serives to different communities who are explicitly and implicitly involved with marine and costal ecosystem e.g. **Commercial Shipping Industry**, **Fishing Industry**, **Sea Food Consumer**, as well as **Interested Research Groups**.

# Description

Here we propose a platform which will provide service and to do so, the solution is divided into two parts. First one is **Sensor Node** which enables the platfrom to collect data oceans to detect the water quality and pollutants. The other one is **Application** which will receive and refine the sensor data, organize the data and perform analytics to provide the services.
